In the example situation we are working in a team with 6 other people. In smaller software projects cloud-based solutions are probably the best option as the configuration process is much simpler and less time consuming. However if the project has some special requirements, such as a need for a graphics card to run tests, a self-hosted CI setup might be needed. In any case, for larger software projects, where more resources are needed, and in larger companies with multiple teams, a self-hosted CI setup is most likely the best option. With cloud-based platforms a larger project might run into some resource limitations.. Self-hosted options, such as Jenkins, are much more flexible, which is why they are in most cases more suitable for bigger projects.
